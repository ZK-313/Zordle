# Zordle
A fully functional copy of wordle written in p5.js JavaScript. The app uses a list of five letter words, selects one at random, and allows you to guess words, giving feedback as to how correct each guess was.

To try the game, please see https://editor.p5js.org/zulfiqar.khan/sketches/aJ55kQu72
